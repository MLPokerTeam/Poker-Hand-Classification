Information of the structure of the data (All this information can be found in the poker-hand.name file):
    
Attribute Information:

1) S1 "Suit of card #1"
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

2) C1 "Rank of card #1"
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

3) S2 "Suit of card #2"
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

4) C2 "Rank of card #2"
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

5) S3 "Suit of card #3"
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

6) C3 "Rank of card #3"
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

7) S4 "Suit of card #4"
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

8) C4 "Rank of card #4"
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

9) S5 "Suit of card #5"
Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}

10) C5 "Rank of card 5"
Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)

11) CLASS "Poker Hand"
Ordinal (0-9)

0: Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand
1: One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards
2: Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards
3: Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards
4: Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps
5: Flush; five cards with the same suit
6: Full house; pair + different rank three of a kind
7: Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards
8: Straight flush; straight + flush
9: Royal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} + flush

The order of cards is important, which is why there
     are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4 (one for each
     suit ï¿½ explained in more detail below).
     
Number of Instances: 25010 training, 1,000,000 testing

Number of Attributes: 10 predictive attributes, 1 goal attribute

9. Class Distribution:

      The first percentage in parenthesis is the representation
      within the training set. The second is the probability in the full domain.

      Training set:

      0: Nothing in hand, 12493 instances (49.95202% / 50.117739%)
      1: One pair, 10599 instances, (42.37905% / 42.256903%)
      2: Two pairs, 1206 instances, (4.82207% / 4.753902%)
      3: Three of a kind, 513 instances, (2.05118% / 2.112845%)
      4: Straight, 93 instances, (0.37185% / 0.392465%)
      5: Flush, 54 instances, (0.21591% / 0.19654%)
      6: Full house, 36 instances, (0.14394% / 0.144058%)
      7: Four of a kind, 6 instances, (0.02399% / 0.02401%)
      8: Straight flush, 5 instances, (0.01999% / 0.001385%)
      9: Royal flush, 5 instances, (0.01999% / 0.000154%)

      The Straight flush and Royal flush hands are not as representative of
      the true domain because they have been over-sampled. The Straight flush
      is 14.43 times more likely to occur in the training set, while the
      Royal flush is 129.82 times more likely.

      Total of 25010 instances in a domain of 311,875,200.

      Testing set:

	The value inside parenthesis indicates the representation within the test
      set as compared to the entire domain. 1.0 would be perfect representation,
      while <1.0 are under-represented and >1.0 are over-represented.

      0: Nothing in hand, 501209 instances,(1.000063)
      1: One pair, 422498 instances,(0.999832)
      2: Two pairs, 47622 instances, (1.001746)
      3: Three of a kind, 21121 instances, (0.999647)
      4: Straight, 3885 instances, (0.989897)
      5: Flush, 1996 instances, (1.015569)
      6: Full house, 1424 instances, (0.988491)
      7: Four of a kind, 230 instances, (0.957934)
      8: Straight flush, 12 instances, (0.866426)
      9: Royal flush, 3 instances, (1.948052)

      Total of one million instances in a domain of 311,875,200.
